## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
library(arulesViz)
library(arules)
library(readr)

rules <- arules::read.PMML("rules_update.xml")


plot(rules, method = "grouped matrix", engine = "interactive")
```
